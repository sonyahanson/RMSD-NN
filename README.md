# RMSD-NN

Here are notebooks used to generate the figures for the work 'Algebraically rigorous quaternion framework for the neural network rotation matching problem'.

The jupyter notebooks included here are dependent on: https://github.com/utiasSTARS/bingham-rotation-learning

The Mathematica notebook was made using version 12.1.1.0 of Mathematica, and it should be self-contained if one runs 'Evaluate Initialization Cells'. Some applications are interactive Manipulate functions, and can be run once initialization is performed. Other cells are graphical output of more complex processes that do not need to be evaluated. However, there is enough information to rerun all figures.
